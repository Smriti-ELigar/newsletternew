                    Elena came to an instant halt as her eyes went to the bed taking in the sight of... It couldn’t be... She looked at her brother who had his head hung low, evidently trying to stop the tears and then at her father, Duke Oberon, who stared at the scene with a blank expression on his tired face. Evelyn’s green eyes welled with tears as she looked at the horrible sight in front of her.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Her sister, Elena, dead...<br/>
                    There was blood gushing down from the left side of her forehead, a bruise on her arm and red color staining the lavender fabric at her chest. A sharp dagger was placed beside her. It adorned the same dark red blood. Her long eyelashes were shut close and her lip were parted and turned into the slightest of smiles. As if, she had been scared to die but died peacefully.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    She heard an ungodly, piercing shriek as she turned her head to find Ms. Daisy with her mouth agape and eyes wide. The blood was drained from her plump rosy cheeks as she stood there sobbing.<br/>
                    It was then, that Evelyn started to see thing double as her vision started to fade and she fell into an abyss of darkness, as she felt her self being caught in the arms of her brother and the voices of her father, brother and cook trying to wake her, she whispered in an almost inaudible voice—
                    <br/><br/>
                    “Elena...”
                    <br/><br/>



                    “Evvie...Evvie? Please wake up. It’s Ethan. Evvie?”<br/>
                    Her eyes fluttered open, she took sometime to adjust to the light and then she saw him. Her older brother Ethan sitting on the bed, with a pillow on his lap and a worried expression on his face.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And then it all came rushing back to her—Her sister was dead. No. Not dead. She had been brutally murdered. A sob escaped Evelyn’s lips as her brother put the pillow aside and embraced her tightly. Almost as if he was scared to lose his younger sister as well. Evelyn clung on to him, sobbing as her tears moistened his brown shirt.
                    Her mother had been one of the only woman ruler who did not go to her husband’s kingdom after marriage and decided to appoint him as the duke and rule the kingdom. She had been a great ruler. Until one day she was found dead. It was uncovered that her mother had been poisoned the night before and there was debate on who would rule next. Her brother, father or sister. Though Ethan, being the oldest argued that it was only fair that he inherited the throne, father had insisted on Elena’s crowning. Hence, Elena had been crowned queen two days ago. And now, even she was dead.
                    After around ten minutes of overwhelmed sobbing by both siblings, Evelyn broke the hug and asked in a voice that sounded like a mix of hurt, grief and anger-
                    “Who?”<br/>
                    Ethan looked at her, bewildered.<br/>
                    “Evvie, I really can’t understand what you--”<br/>
                    “WHO MURDERED ELENA?”<br/>
                    “There is an investigation going on and as of now all her servants have been ruled out a she had asked for privacy in the inner chambers and no one knows who went in or out through the east door as the guard was ill and on a leave. I wanted to talk to her about something when I saw her dead on the bed in her chamber. She was already dead by the time I reached. Her heart wasn’t beating. Then father came in and started sobbing and asked me to come get you.” Ethan replied looking up at her but not looking into her green, bloodshot eyes.
                    “How long have I been out?”  asked Evelyn.<br/>
                    “Almost two days. Father decided to get her cremation over with”<br/>
                    “I want to be left alone.” She said in an expressionless voice.<br/>
                    Her brother left without a word. As soon as the door closed, she broke down sobbing once again.
                    <br/><br/>

                    It had been a month since the murder and they still weren’t able to find the murderer. Evelyn was walking around in the Enchanted Garden, as she watched the pixies laugh and play about, she remembered her sister. Who was blessed with the gift of magic. It had been truly wonderous to see her perform such tricks. Replaying the events in her head, she re-thought a certain scene in her head. Again, and again. And she dashed off, her red velvet ankle length gown giving her a slightly speedier run. That certain scene playing in her head as she ran there.<br/>
                    To Elena’s chambers.<br/>
                    She almost crashed into one of the servants as she came to halt. Panting and trying to catch her breath. The maid servant was clearly frightened.<br/>
                    “Your Highness?”<br/>
                    “You used to work in Late Majesty Elena’s chambers, right?”<br/>
                    “Why yes!”<br/>
                    “Then answer my questions with all the knowledge of the situation which you have.”<br/>
                    “Okay?”<br/>
                    “Who was the first to enter the chambers after Her Majesty requested privacy?”<br/>
                    “His Highness Prince Ethan was the first to enter.” The servant replied getting a hint of where this conversation was going.<br/>
                    “Was the East door locked?”<br/>
                    “Yes. The keys were with the guard. Although Her Majesty and Duke Oberon did have keys to the door too.”<br/>
                    “Which door did Ethan enter through?”<br/>
                    “West Door”<br/>
                    “Did anyone enter after Ethan?”<br/>
                    “I wasn’t there at the door at the time. His Highness Prince Ethan had summoned me.”<br/>
                    “Thank you....” Evelyn paused at her name.<br/>
                    “Sienna” the girl replied<br/>
                    “Thank you, Sienna”<br/>
                    The two girls smiled at each other knowing that they had found the culprit.<br/>
                    Ethan.<br/><br/>

                    Evelyn barged into her brother’s room unannounced and stomping. Ethan flinched ever so slightly and then she noticed him holding something that double confirmed her suspicions.<br/>
                    The Dagger.<br/>
                    “YOU! YOU KILLED HER!” Evelyn screamed.<br/>
                    “Evvie I re-” started Ethan looking shocked and surprised at his sister’s sudden outburst.
                    “Don’t ‘Evvie’ me! I know you killed her. I know you killed Elena. You were just jealous that she was to be queen! You didn’t even care about mum’s last wish! You were the first to enter her inner chambers and you even have the dagger which was used to stab her which definitely means that -YOU MURDERED HER...” she yelled<br/>
                    Ethan looked like he was about die. His face was pale and his chocolate brown eyes were pitch black<br/>
                    “You killed your own sister! How ruthless are you?” She yelled, shaking with anger.<br/>
                    “Evvie, think whatever you want but I would never murder someone just to rule a kingdom. Come back to me when you’re in a better state of mind.” said Ethan expressionlessly leaving the princess shocked.<br/>
                    “He didn’t cry... He didn’t yell... It was definitely him!” she thought to herself walking toward the kitchen for a glass of water.<br/>
                    But what she saw when she entered the kitchen made her anger vanish as she stood spellbound.<br/>
                    It was Ms. Daisy. Her fingers guiding the floating utensils to their respective places. It was the same magic her sister possessed. Evelyn gasped in shock, but it didn’t catch the cook’s attention. It was then that Evelyn noticed someone standing next to the cook. A look of concern and shock on her face too. She was one of the head cook’s most trusted assistant, as Evelyn identified. The environment was dull and she heard a few sniffles from Ms. Daisy. Just as she was about to approach the two Ms. Daisy broke into hysterical sobs...<br/>
                    “I killed her! I killed her! I killed Her Majesty” Ms. Daisy sobbed<br/>
                    The young princess’s eyes widened in disbelief. How could Ms. Daisy kill her sis-<br/>
                    “I KILLED HER MAJESTY LYSANDRA! I POISONED HER!” she sobbed and screamed on the top her lungs.<br/>
                    Evelyn couldn’t believe what she had just heard...<br/>
                    “How could you?” Evelyn screamed.<br/>
                    The cook and her assistant turned to look at her their faces filled with shock, fear and... shame...<br/>
                    “Your Highness I-” the cook started<br/>
                    “Why?” sobbed Evelyn<br/>
                    “Your sister died when she was born. And I had to sacrifice my child for the satisfaction of your father who didn’t want to see his wife miserable. I gave my child. Saw her call another woman her mother. Saw her hug and cuddle another woman. And your mother wasn’t aware that she was raising someone else’s daughter...When she found out about my magic and related it to your sister’s, she thought it was a co-incidence. When I decided to tell her the truth, SHE REFUSED TO GIVE ME MY CHILD BACK. What could I do? I poisoned her that night. I wanted to tell Elena about this before she....” the cook stopped not wanting to utter the word as she broke down once more, wailing.<br/>
                    Evelyn stormed out of the kitchen and went to the only other person she could talk to or trust.<br/>
                    Her father.<br/>
                    The door to the room was open. He looked up at Evelyn the moment he sensed a presence at his doorstep.<br/>
                    “Evelyn, darling come here.” He said affectionately patting the seat on the couch beside him.<br/>
                    Evelyn entered without uttering a word. As soon as she sat down, she poured out everything. About Ethan and Ms. Daisy. Her father listened intently an unreadable expression on his face.<br/>
                    “I wish I knew what Elena’s last word were. Last happy words at least...” said Evelyn now sobbing uncontrollably.<br/>
                    “I know my child.. I know. The fact that she was pinned to the wall, threatened, vase smashed to her head and stabbed brutally to death... It’s something that no father would want for his daughter. Her last words were happy she said “Tell Evvie and Eth that I love them-.”.”he went on gushing until he realised what he had just said.<br/>
                    Evelyn’s jaw dropped as she heard what he said. Her second biggest shock for the day as she put the peices of the puzzle together... sienna had said that he had the keys to the east door. And then she realised that Ethan had called her to the crime scene when she was walking through the hall opposite east door which meant that the door had been open and he didn’t notice.<br/>
                    “How dare you!” she said through clenched teeth.<br/>
                    “YOUR MOTHER wouldn’t let me rule her kingdom and decided to give the kingdom to your sister of all the people in the world instead of me. The woman was absolutely obsessed with woman ruling. To get your brother to step down from his desire to rule, I had to get your sister crowned. And when she was crowned, I killed her. Now, the decision would be in my hands... That was until you came along and spoilt everything.. You little.. ” he started to lunge forward at her until he was pulled back by a strong pair of arms..
                    Ethan.<br/>
                    And the investigation guards.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The poor princess broke into sobs once again only to be held by her brother. She kept chanting how sorry she was till he told her that it was alright. He stayed with her the whole night comforting her.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Ten days, later, The court took a decision. Oberon and Ms. Daisy were to be sentenced to life-time jail... The siblings were left alone.<br/>
                    “Ethan?”<br/>
                    “Yes, Evvie?”<br/>
                    “Are you ready to rule Veridian Glade?” she asked a slight smile on her lips as Ethan smiled.<br/>
                    “With pleasure.”
